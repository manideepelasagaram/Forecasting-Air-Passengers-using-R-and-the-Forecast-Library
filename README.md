# Forecasting Air Passengers using R and the Forecast Library

In this R script, we aim to forecast the number of air passengers over a specified period using time series analysis techniques. We begin by loading the necessary libraries, including the forecast package.

## Data Preparation
We load the AirPassengers dataset, which contains monthly air passenger numbers from 1949 to 1960. After loading the data, we convert it into a time series object (ts) to facilitate time-based analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
We start by visualizing the time series data using the plot() function, which displays the trend and seasonality in the number of air passengers over the specified period.

## Model Fitting and Testing Predictability
We fit an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to the time series data using the Arima() function. Specifically, we fit an AR(1) model to capture the autocorrelation in the data. We then test the predictability of the AR(1) model by examining the significance of the autoregressive coefficient.

## Model Diagnostic and Identification of Autocorrelation
We perform model diagnostics by examining the summary statistics of the AR(1) model and conduct hypothesis testing to evaluate the significance of the autoregressive coefficient. Additionally, we analyze the autocorrelation function (ACF) plot to identify any remaining autocorrelation in the first-differenced data.

## Time Series Partitioning
To train and validate our forecasting model, we partition the time series data into training and validation sets. The training set includes data from January 1949 to December 2013, while the validation set consists of data from January 2014 to December 2018.

## Forecasting
Finally, we use various forecasting techniques, such as exponential smoothing and ARIMA modeling, to predict future air passenger numbers based on historical data. We evaluate the accuracy of the forecasts using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE).

## Conclusion 
Overall, this script provides a comprehensive approach to forecasting air passenger numbers using time series analysis techniques in R, allowing us to make informed decisions and predictions based on historical data patterns.
